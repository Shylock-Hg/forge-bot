# Registering Forgejo webhooks

How to point Forgejo at forge-bot so `@<bot>` mentions are delivered as
webhooks. There are four hook scopes; pick the broadest one you have rights
for. A **system** (or user/org) hook covers repositories created later, so you
do not have to touch it again.

| Scope | Covers | Who can create it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Repository | one repository | repository owner or admin |
| Organization | every repository in an organization | organization owner |
| User | every repository owned by a user | that user |
| System | every repository on the instance | instance administrator |

The hook target is always the bot's webhook route:

```text
http://<bot-host>:8080/webhooks/forgejo
```

`127.0.0.1` is fine when Forgejo and the bot run on the same host.

---

## Before you start

1. The bot is running and reachable from the Forgejo server
   (`curl http://<bot-host>:8080/healthz`).
2. You have a shared secret. Generate one and put the **same** value in the
   bot config (`[forgejo] webhook_secret`, or `FORGEJO_WEBHOOK_SECRET`) and in
   the hook:

   ```bash
   openssl rand -hex 32
   ```

3. The hook creator has the required rights (table above) and, for the API, a
   token with enough scope:
   * repository hook: `write:repository` on the repo (owner/admin),
   * organization hook: org admin,
   * user hook: the user's own token,
   * system hook: an instance-admin token (`write:admin` scope).

---

## Shared request values

All four scopes send the same payload; only the endpoint differs. Put the
target URL and secret in the environment first:

```bash
export FORGEJO_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3000
export FORGEJO_WEBHOOK_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
export BOT_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080/webhooks/forgejo

# Reuse this body for every scope below.
export HOOK_BODY='{
  "type": "forgejo",
  "active": true,
  "events": ["issue_comment", "pull_request_comment", "pull_request_review_comment", "issues", "pull_request"],
  "config": {
    "url": "'"$BOT_URL"'",
    "content_type": "json",
    "secret": "'"$FORGEJO_WEBHOOK_SECRET"'",
    "http_method": "post"
  }
}'
```

Copy `FORGEJO_WEBHOOK_SECRET` into the bot config/EnvironmentFile as well.

---

## Helper script

[`contrib/register-webhook.sh`](../contrib/register-webhook.sh) creates hooks
for any scope. It defaults to a **user-level** hook:

```bash
# user-level: every repository owned by the token's user (default)
./contrib/register-webhook.sh

# a single repository (REPO defaults to the current git remote)
SCOPE=repo ./contrib/register-webhook.sh

# an organization
SCOPE=org ORG=my-org ./contrib/register-webhook.sh

# whole instance (instance-admin token)
SCOPE=system ./contrib/register-webhook.sh
```

It validates its inputs and prints the required scope/role when Forgejo
rejects the request. Set `HOOK_ID=<id>` to `PATCH` an existing hook instead of
creating a new one (useful after changing `EVENTS`):

```bash
# list hooks to find the id, then update it
curl -s -H "Authorization: token $TOKEN" "$FORGEJO_URL/api/v1/user/hooks"
HOOK_ID=3 ./contrib/register-webhook.sh
```

---

## 1. Repository webhook

**UI:** Repository → **Settings → Webhooks → Add Webhook → Forgejo**.

**API:**

```bash
export TOKEN=...        # owner/admin token
export REPO=owner/repo

curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: token $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  "$FORGEJO_URL/api/v1/repos/$REPO/hooks" \
  -d "$HOOK_BODY"
```

## 2. Organization webhook

**UI:** Organization → **Settings → Webhooks → Add Webhook → Forgejo**.

**API:**

```bash
export TOKEN=...        # organization owner token
export ORG=my-org

curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: token $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  "$FORGEJO_URL/api/v1/orgs/$ORG/hooks" \
  -d "$HOOK_BODY"
```

## 3. User webhook (all repositories of one user)

The cheapest instance-wide option when the repositories belong to one account.

**UI:** User **Settings → Webhooks → Add Webhook → Forgejo**.

**API:**

```bash
export TOKEN=...        # that user's own token

curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: token $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  "$FORGEJO_URL/api/v1/user/hooks" \
  -d "$HOOK_BODY"
```

## 4. System webhook (whole instance)

**UI:** **Site Administration → System Webhooks → Add Webhook → Forgejo**.

**API:**

```bash
export TOKEN=...        # instance-admin token

curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: token $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  "$FORGEJO_URL/api/v1/admin/hooks" \
  -d "$HOOK_BODY"
```

This fires for every repository on the instance, including ones created later.

## Events

Forgejo lets a hook subscribe to several events. The body above enables the
ones that can carry a mention:

| Event | Payload | forge-bot status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `issue_comment` | issue + PR conversation comments | handled |
| `pull_request_comment` | submitted reviews (body + inline comments) | handled |
| `pull_request_review_comment` | inline review comments (older Forgejo) | handled |
| `issues` | issue opened/edited (description) | handled |
| `pull_request` | PR opened/edited (description) | handled |

Forgejo's `pull_request_comment` payload only carries the review body; it does
not inline the individual review comments. When the bot sees a review it
fetches the newest review's comments through the API to find mentions in them,
so the token needs read access to the repository. `pull_request_review_comment`
is kept for Forgejo versions that inline the comment.

A mention in an inline review comment is answered **in the same thread**: the
bot posts the acknowledgement and the agent's summary back as a review comment
on the same review, file and line, instead of appending a top-level comment to
the pull request. This needs write access to the repository, which is the same
permission required to comment at all.

Description events are deduplicated by a hash of the body, so an edit that
changes the text triggers once while re-deliveries of the same text are
ignored. Other events are accepted (`202` with `accepted: 0`) and ignored.

---

## Loopback / local addresses

By default Forgejo may refuse to deliver to `127.0.0.1` or private addresses.
If Test Delivery fails with a host error, the instance administrator must
allow the target in `app.ini`:

```ini
[webhook]
ALLOWED_HOST_LIST = 127.0.0.1, localhost
# during bring-up only:
# ALLOWED_HOST_LIST = *
```

then restart Forgejo. If that is not an option, keep the bot's poller enabled
instead.

---

## Verify

1. **UI:** use **Test Delivery** on the hook — expect HTTP `202` and
   `{"accepted":0}` (a test payload has no mention).
2. **Locally sign a delivery:**

   ```bash
   FORGEJO_WEBHOOK_SECRET=... ./contrib/test-webhook.sh
   ```

3. **Post a real mention** from an allowed user and watch the bot log:

   ```bash
   journalctl -u forge-bot -f          # or ~/.local/state/forge-bot/forge-bot.log
   ```

   You should see `job queued`, `spawned pi agent`, and a reply comment on the
   issue/PR.

Requests with a missing or wrong `X-Forgejo-Signature` get `401 Unauthorized`.

## Manage hooks

```bash
# repository / organization / user / system
curl -H "Authorization: token $TOKEN" "$FORGEJO_URL/api/v1/repos/$REPO/hooks"
curl -H "Authorization: token $TOKEN" "$FORGEJO_URL/api/v1/orgs/$ORG/hooks"
curl -H "Authorization: token $TOKEN" "$FORGEJO_URL/api/v1/user/hooks"
curl -H "Authorization: token $TOKEN" "$FORGEJO_URL/api/v1/admin/hooks"

# delete (use the id from the list)
curl -X DELETE -H "Authorization: token $TOKEN" \
  "$FORGEJO_URL/api/v1/repos/$REPO/hooks/<id>"
```

---

## Webhook vs poller

Run **one** delivery path per repository:

* Webhooks are push-based (near real-time, no polling load) but need a hook
  with the right scope.
* The poller needs only read access and no hook, at the cost of a polling
  interval and per-repo requests.

Once a webhook covers a repository, set `[poller] enabled = false` in the bot
config (or restrict `[poller] repositories` to the ones still not covered).
Running both paths would deliver the same comment twice, because the webhook
dedupe and the poller cursor are independent.
