//! Job queue and session persistence.
//!
//! A webhook creates a [`Job`]. Jobs are queued, persisted to disk (so a crash
//! or restart does not lose them), and executed by a bounded scheduler. Runs
//! are serialized per conversation and different conversations run in
//! parallel, so a busy thread never blocks an unrelated issue or pull request.
//! Each repository/issue pair gets a [`Session`](store::Session) that groups
//! successive runs, which is what makes follow-up mentions in the same thread
//! feel like a conversation.
